## Hello there 👋

I'm Jonathan. I love being driven crazy by my stacktrace and besides that i mostly spend my time cooking and eating ramen. 🍜

Besides that i'm a master student of applied computer science @ Ruhr University Bochum. 
My main focus lies on (adversarial) machine learning, deep learning and computer vision. 🔬💻
